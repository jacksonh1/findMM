# findMM

findMM will be a simple, python-based command line utility for identifying the multi-mapping transcripts and their multi-mapping connectivity to other transcripts in a reference transcriptome fasta file. The approach to identifying the multi-mapping transcripts is similar to the [`crossmap`](https://plastid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/plastid.bin.crossmap.html) script from the plastid package. I highly recommend crossmap for working with reference genome and if you want a mask file specifying the specific multi-mapping regions of the genome.

Requirements:
- [bowtie](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)
- [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)
- python 3.6 or later
- bowtie, samtools, and python in PATH
